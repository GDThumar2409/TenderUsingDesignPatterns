# TenderUsingDesignPatterns

1. DAO Pattern
  --All Database Operation are of this type.
  --The Data Access Object (DAO) pattern is a structural pattern that allows us to isolate the application/business layer from the
  persistence layer (usually a relational database, but it could be any other persistence mechanism) using an abstract API.

2.Mediator Pattern
   --mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping
   objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets us vary their interaction independently.
   --Used in Auction of Tender.
