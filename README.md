# TenderUsingDesignPatterns

# 1. DAO Pattern
  ```sh
  All Database Operation are of this type.
  ```
  ```sh
  The Data Access Object (DAO) pattern is a structural pattern that allows us to isolate the application/business layer from the
  persistence layer (usually a relational database, but it could be any other persistence mechanism) using an abstract API.
  ```

# 2.Mediator Pattern

  ```sh
  Mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping
  objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets us vary their interaction independently.
  ```
  ```sh
  Used for Auction of Tender.
  ```
